# Rekall-Corportation-Pen-Test-Report
Above is a word document with all the findings of this project. 
Pen testing Project

Conducted a comprehensive reconnaissance of the Rekall web application, identifying multiple security weaknesses. Utilized tools such as Nmap, Nessus, and nslookup to uncover additional vulnerabilities. Leveraged Kali Linux to execute exploits, including SLMail and Kiwi, enhancing the organizationâ€™s understanding of its security posture and providing actionable insights to strengthen system defenses.
This multi-day project provided valuable hands-on penetration testing experience, strengthening my capabilities as a cybersecurity professional. The skills gained are directly applicable to both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) roles
